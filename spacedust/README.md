# Spacedust Front End

## Getting Started

Welcome to SpaceDust, the sample front end app for Securing Angular Applications!

Start by installing the dependencies. Make sure you have Node installed and then run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the App

Run the app with the Angular CLI

```bash
ng serve
```

## Get an mLab Account

The login and signup transactions won't work until you have set up the API and connected to mLab. See the readme for the Node.js API for instructions on that.
